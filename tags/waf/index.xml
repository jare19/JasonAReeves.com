      <description>Go Fastly is a Golang API client for interacting with most facets of the Fastly API.
There was an API endpoint missing from the go-fastly API client, Event Logs. I added the event logs endpoint to the package as well as all the tests. I also noticed that the returned objects for the dictionary objects and items were not up to date so I updated those as well.</description>
