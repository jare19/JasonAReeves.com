      <description>Port Authority is a solution that I helped develop at Target. I was included in the development after it was 1&amp;frasl;2 way complete. I was able to enable scanning of images pulled from Docker Hub (exisiting functunality was to scan images from private repos), as well as create a drone.io plugin to enable pipeline scanning of a container in github enterprise. It was my first real world experience with Go and API development.</description>
